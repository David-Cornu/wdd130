        <h1>Arthurian Legend</h1>
        <p>
            Arthur proved he was the son of Uther by pulling the sword from the stone. After pulling the sword there were a few lords that refused to swear
             loyaltie to a young boy. Arthur then fought wars against these lords proving to them that Arthur was trully their king. At the end of those wars 
             each of those lords swore loyaltie to Arthur. During this time Arthur went with Merlin to the Lady of the Lake to get a sword to replace his sword that broke. The Lady of the Lake had Arthur do a chalenge
             to prove he was worthy of her sword. By being able to get to the sword, being held out of the lake by the arm of a maiden, Arthur proved he was worthy of the sword.
             The sword that Arthur aquired was the legendary Excailiber. Arthur's time after those wars was spent defending his kingdom from the saxon invaders and doing quests. 
             The Knights of the Round table were formed after peace was in the land. The kinghts went on quests to bring honor to King Arthur and the round
             Arthur's rule ended after his nephew Mordred tried to take over the kingdom when Arthur was away. When Arthur returned he battled for the kigndom.
             Arthur killed Mordred on the feild of battle, and Mordred gave Arthur a faitle wound. As he was Dieing Arthur had Bedivere throw Excailiber back to the Lady of the Lake.
             After Excailiberwas returned Morgana Le Fey and others got Arthur and took him to Avolon to heal him. Arthur is said to return in the worlds greatist time of need.

            When one hears of King Arthur many different things. Though the question is how has the adaptations, of the legend of Arthur and his knights,
            influanced what the legend has become. Though one could spend a life time looking at midevial texts, the point of intrest here are the modern
            adaptations. Because one thing is certain, Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are not done evolving.

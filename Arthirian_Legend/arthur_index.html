        <h1>Arthurian Legend</h1>
        <p>
            Arthur proved he was the son of Uther by pulling the sword from the stone. After pulling the sword there were a few lords that refused to swear
             loyalty to a young boy. Arthur then fought wars against these lords proving to them that Arthur was truly their king. At the end of those wars 
             each of those lords swore loyalty to Arthur. During this time Arthur went with Merlin to the Lady of the Lake to get a sword to replace his sword that broke. The Lady of the Lake had Arthur do a challenge
             to prove he was worthy of her sword. By being able to get to the sword, being held out of the lake by the arm of a maiden, Arthur proved he was worthy of the sword.
             The sword that Arthur acquired was the legendary Excalibur. Arthur's time after those wars was spent defending his kingdom from the Saxon invaders and doing quests. 
             The Knights of the Round table were formed after peace was in the land. The knights went on quests to bring honor to King Arthur and the round
             Arthur's rule ended after his nephew Mordred tried to take over the kingdom when Arthur was away. When Arthur returned, he battled for the kingdom.
             Arthur killed Mordred on the field of battle, and Mordred gave Arthur a fatal wound. As he was dying Arthur had Bedivere throw Excalibur back to the Lady of the Lake.
             After Excalibur was returned Morgana Le Fey and others got Arthur and took him to Avalon to heal him. Arthur is said to return in the worldâ€™s greatest time of need.

            When one hears of King Arthur many different things. Though the question is how has the adaptations, of the legend of Arthur and his knights,
            influenced what the legend has become. Though one could spend a lifetime looking at medieval texts, the point of interest here are the modern
            adaptations. Because one thing is certain, Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are not done evolving. Where they go from here will be 
            interesting to see.

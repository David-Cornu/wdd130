            The Sword in the Stone
        </h1>
        <p>
            Arthur in this adaptation seems younger than normal for when he pulls the Sword in the Stone. Normally Arthur is at youngest 16 but in
            this adaptation he seems to be about 12. Sir Ector seems to not know who Merlin is which is odd unless Merlin is not the one who gave 
            Arthur to Sir Ector. The way Sir Ector treats Arthur is also different from normal. In most adaptations Arthur and Kay were raised as
            brothers. To the point that when Arthur pulled the sword, he still saw Sir Ector as his father and Arthur gave Sir Kay a special position
            in the kingdom. Though in The Sword in the Stone Arthur is mistreated by Sir Ector and Arthur was treated as a servant not a son.
            The teaching of Merlin was fun but not part of the normal telling of the legends. Normally Arthur has no idea who Merlin is on their first
            meeting.

            This adaptation is fun to watch. Though it doesn't follow the traditional telling of the Arthurian Legends, it follows the telling by
            T. H. White of the same title. The Sword in the Stone is adaptation for kids to enjoy.

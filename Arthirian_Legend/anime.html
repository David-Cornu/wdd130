        Fate
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Fate series is surprisingly close to the Arthurian Legend. It is surprising because Arthur in Fate is a woman who pretended to be a man
        during her life. Other than some of the knights also being gender bent and Excalibur being a two-handed weapon it gets the details correct.
        Though if it ever shows Arthur's Britain it is in a flash back. In Fate heroes are summand by mages to fight in the modern world for the Holy
        Grail. The mages and the summand heroes have a wish they want granted. Things in Fate can get confusing quickly though the back stories of the
        summand heroes is mostly accurate to their real world legends.
    </p>
    <p>
        The King Arthur from Fate is one of the closest depictions of the Arthurian Legends made recently. Which is sad considering Arthur in the Fate
        series is a woman. That should make Fate the least accurate, but the creator got the other things right. The creator of Fate thought about doing 
        a male Arthur but changed his mind in pre-production for some reason.

    <h1>Seven Deadly Sins</h1>
    <p>
        This version of Arthur is young just starting his rule and not a main character. He is more of an important secondary character. The anime The Seven 
        Deadly Sins focuses on characters that didn't play a big part in the Arthurian Legend. When Arthur first appears in the show it is just so Merlin
        can be part of the main cast. In a later section of the show Arthur has more to do. Namely he acquires Excalibur which was a little odd. In this anime
        Arthur was already king before he pulled the sword from the stone. The Sword in the Stone and Excalibur were also combined into the same sword. 
        Which does seem to be a common mistake people seem to make. It will be interesting to see what The Seven Deadly Sins will do with Arthur after were
        the show left him.
    </p>
    <p>
        The show is a fun watch if odd at times. With it spending time away from Arthur and focusing on undermentioned characters there is less to compare it to.
        Though when the major players from the Arthurian Legend do show up it shows the liberties taken with the source material, because of how unknown most of
        the characters used are.
